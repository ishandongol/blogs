[Sajilo Recharge](https://ishandongol.com.np/portfolio/sajilorecharge/) is an **Application for Android™** that scans the recharge card for pin numbers and runs the USSD code. You can download Sajilo Recharge form Google Play.



Sajilo Recharge is my first ever production application. I developed Sajilo Recharge during my Bachelor’s second year. It took me around two weeks to complete the whole application. The application was ready but I had no idea how the whole thing worked. I didn’t imagine that it would be such a success.&#x20;
